Dance With Intensity Theme for SM5

A theme based on the DWI simulator by SimWolf, I've made it for some nostalgia of the 2000's simulators. Most of the graphics are from the original game, some others have been edited to maintain compatibility.

The DWI announcer (djDraftHorse) can be downloaded from here - http://www.mediafire.com/download/acci9j07971ifg6/DWI.rar

Thanks to SimWolf for the original DWI, and to AJ187 from some metrics of his SM4 theme. Also to my friend Jose Varela for some graphics/coding help and ideas.
